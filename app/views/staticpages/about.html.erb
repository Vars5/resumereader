				<h4>ResQuery uses what works to separate you from the rest</h4>
				<p>The information we put onto our website is based
					off what has worked for other applicants in the past, 
					continuously updated with relevant information - not
					just HR speak</p>
				</br>
				<h4>We will never profit from employers</h4>
				<p>We want to help <strong>you</strong> get employed and its too easy to
					become an advertising channel for employers.
					we won't compromise on our independence to achieve that.</p>
				</br> 
			
				<h4>Your Data is not for sale</h4>
				<p>We won't sell your data out to employers or anyone else either.</p>
				</br>
				
				<h4>We'll just list the key employers for your uni</h4>
				<p> We won't list everything under the sun to help you manage some of your key opportunities</p>
